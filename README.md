## Purpose

Have you heard about github? Wonder why developers always seem to be typing into the terminal? Or are you developer that wants to enhance your skills and supercharge your development workflow?

In this workshop, we will cover:
- The basics of how and why to use the terminal (aka the commandline)
- How to use git to version control your work
- What is github and why is it helpful for collaborating on teams

We will start with the basics of how to use the commandline to navigate around the folders on your computer, create files, carefully remove files, move / copy files and compress / zip them.

In the git section, we will learn the basics of using git for version control to save your work and rescue you when you manage to break something.

As for github, we will introduce you to the purpose of github and demonstrate why is it incredibly popular for the software development community. In this section, we will show you how to copy project repositories to your local computer and how to use the commandline to push up your saved work to your public project.
